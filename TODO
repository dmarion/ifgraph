Those are the urgent things I plan to do in next releases:
1) Reorganize the code: There are some redundancies that may slow the program execution
2) More docs
3) Create an ifgraph.pm containing common code to ifgraph.pl, makegraph.pl and find-if.pl
down a bit the program and are making it harder to understand.
4) Comments: Add more comments and functions descriptions to make
easier to other people to read and rewrite the code.
5) SNMPv2 and v3 support.
6) Make it use less memory by reorganizing data structures (Working on it)
