----------
Those are sh scripts that I used to monitor some linux 
2.4.* machines. Some of them require sed, awk, dig, wc, 
the proc filesystem and other common system tools. They 
are pretty simple scripts (almost lame), but are working 
just fine for me.

You will find three files inside the directories:
- the script itself (.sh extension)
- a [target] config for the script (.conf extension)
- a README, describing whats the script for

There is also a squid_monitoring directory, containing
an example config file to monitor some squid data.

Use this files at your own risk. Feel free to create new or
to improve these ones. Send the modifications to me, if 
you like: sartori@lrv.ufsc.br.
