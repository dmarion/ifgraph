partition_usage.sh
------------------
This script will use the df command to show the partition
usage in megabytes (-m flag to df). It will get the
total partition size, the used space and the free space.
If you want to visualize it in a different base unit,
say kbytes, alter the df flag in the partition_usage.sh
script.
This script requires a parameter to work. You must
show what is the partition the script will get information
for. Like this:
command=/path/to/partition_usage.sh sda5
